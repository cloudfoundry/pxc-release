  logging.format.timestamp:
    description: |
      Format for timestamp in component logs. Valid values are 'rfc3339', 'unix-epoch'. 'rfc3339' is the recommended
      format. It will result in all timestamps controlled by this job to be in RFC3339 format, which is human readable.
      This includes stdout, pre-start, and post-start logs. This does not include stderr logs from golang libraries.
      'unix-epoch' will result in all timestamps being in the format they were before the rfc3339 flag was introduced.
      This format is different for different logs. We do not recommend using this flag unless you have scripts that
      expect a particular timestamp format.
    default: "rfc3339"
  available_when_read_only:
    description: >
        Health checks for mysql nodes which have the 'read-only' option enabled will be considered healthy. If enabled,
        the proxy job will send traffic to a read-only backend, but "write" queries will fail with an error.
